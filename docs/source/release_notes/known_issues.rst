Known Issues
============

- Nsight Python launches the application python script again with NVIDIA Nsight Compute CLI (ncu) for each ``@nsight.analyze.kernel`` decorator.
- Kernels launched from a subprocess which is created within the annotated region will not be profiled.
- For the ``nsight.analyze.kernel``'s ``replay_mode="range"`` option, only a subset of CUDA APIs are supported within the annotated range. If an unsupported API call is detected, an error will be reported. For details on supported APIs, refer to the `NVIDIA Nsight Compute Profiling Guide <https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#supported-apis>`_. In such cases, you can either switch to ``replay_mode="kernel"`` or modify the code to exclude the unsupported API from the annotated range.
